This folder's content are adaptations from Kim et al. (2011). 

Main analysis algorithms are fragmented in several parts to speed up the analysis paralellizing its computation on a cluster. They can be found in ModellingFragmented and CausalFragmented. Causal part2 contains the final part of CausalTest analysis after fragmentation. 

data FOLDER contains simulated activity we used for the analysis.

Two fragmented FOLDERS have compartmentalization of the analysis to be implemented in a cluster and parallelized. 

Causal Part2 have the final processing of causal test after fragmented.
