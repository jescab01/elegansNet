This folder's content are adaptations from Kim et al. (2011). 

Main script is demo_sim.m where we calculate Generalized linear models to predict the activity of each neuron as a function of all other neurons activity. It uses additional scripts as log_likelihood_win.m and glmwin.m.

Second main script is CausalTest.m which calculates Granger Causality, difining if a connection between two neurons is statistically significant. It uses log_likelihood_causal, glmcausal and FDR (False discovery rate). 

data FOLDER contains simulated activity we used for the analysis.

Results FOLDER, you know.. haha ;).
