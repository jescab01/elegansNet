This directory contains all information to set up the network before simulating. It will setup C. elegans network with all its neurons and connections. 

	- "paramterTesting" FOLDER contains .csv files from gathering measures to test parameters and activity in "paramterTesting".

	- "1celltype_Setup.py". This script will add atributes of 'sensor' (mechano, chemo, propio, etc.), 'area' (head, body, tail) and 'LRb' (left, right, body) to sensory neurons, and the attribute 'cell_type' (motor, sensory or interneuron) to each node. 

	- "2connectomeSetup.py", add connections to the network in python. 

	- "elegans.herm_connectome.graphml" is the result of all the process of network setup. This will be the file used in our simulator representing the structure of the network. 

	- "networkSetup" FOLDER contains al information to generate the final "elegans.herm_connectome.graphml" from 1celltype_Setup.py and 2connectomeSetup.py scritps. Inside that folder:

		'c302-NeuroML2' folder, coming from openWorm project: https://github.com/openworm/c302/tree/master/c302/NeuroML2. It contains 3D positions for each neuron. 

		'1.0elegans.herm_nodesPos.graphml' this file contains a basic graphml version of the network only with nodes and their positions in 3D defined by data in OpenWorm project. The data used is in c302-NeuroML2 folder which contains a model for every neuron. We used a previous version in Cao (2017). 

		'1.1sensorycells.csv' information about type of sensors for each sensory cell and additional information (sensor, area, LRb) obtained from: 'http://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/nervous/Neuroframeset.html'.

		'1.2cell_types.csv' contains information about the type of cell for each neuron. Data manually reviewed from wormatlas.org neuron by neuron. 

		'1.3elegans.herm_nodestypes.graphml' is an updated graphml generated by '1celltype_setup.py' containing the information previously exposed inside networkSetup folder.  

		'2.0herm_full_edgelist.csv': Edges were extracted from Wormwiring.org.

		'2.1herm_connections.csv': update previous .csv by removing edges to muscles.  

		'2.2NeurotransmitterMap.csv': The main neurotransmitter used by each neuron comes from 'Pereira (2015) A cellular and regulatory map of the cholinergic nervous system of C. elegans'.
