This branch contains the data necesary to mount the pharyngenal nervous system of C elegans (20 neurons). 

----------------------------------------

1celltype_Setup.py. This script will add atributes of 'sensor' (mechano, chemo, propio, etc.), 'area' (head, body, tail) and 'LRb' (left, right, body) to sensory neurons, and the attribute 'cell_type' (motor, sensory or interneuron) to each node. 


networkSetup folder contains datasets generated by each step of 1celltype_Setup.py and 2connectomeSetup.py scritps to transform a simple .graphml containing basic information of neurons into a complete one.

'1.0elegans.herm_nodesPos.graphml' this file contains a basic graphml version of the network only with nodes and their positions in 3D defined by data in OpenWorm project. The data used is in c302-NeuroML2 folder which contains a model for every neuron.  

'1.1sensoryNeurons.csv' contains an excel sheet with every sensory cell sorted by column (sensor type: mechanosensor, nociceptor, chemosensor, thermosensors, etc.) obtained from: 'http://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/nervous/Neuroframeset.html'.

'1.2sensorycells.csv' is an updated version of sensoryNeurons, removing duplicated cells and additional information (sensor, area, LRb).

'1.3cell_types' contains information about the type of cell for each neuron. Data manually reviewed from wormatlas.org neuron by neuron. 


------------------------------------------

Data provenance.

An original '.graphml' was extracted from: [check Cao's reference]. Updated with all neurons and their 3D positions from OpenWorm project: c302/NeuroML2. Also removed all the edges:'elegans.herm_onlynodes.graphml'.

Edges were extracted from OpenWorm/c302/c302/data: 'herm_full_edgelist_MODIFIED.csv'. It was updated by removing edges from neurons to muscles: 'herm_connectome.csv'. 

Finally, .graphml is updated to 'elegans_herm.graphml' with every node and connection between neurons.

Note that some neurons found in NeuroML2 folder (VD12, VD13, MDL08) don't have connections in original 'herm_full_edgelist_MODIFIED.csv'. 

The type of chemical neurotransmitter used by the neuron: neurotransmitterMap.csv comes from 'Pereira (2015) A cellular and regulatory map of the cholinergic nervous system of C. elegans' (table2) Neurotransmitter map of the hermaphrodite nervous system'.

Finally, new graphml is built: elegans.herm_connectome.graphml 

The code for the update is in 'connectomeSetup.py'.


'elegans.herm_connectome.graphml' is the final output of the process. The process can be checked in 'cellType_setup.py'.
